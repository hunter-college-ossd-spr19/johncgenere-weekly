# Reported Issues

This week we looked into the blogs of the other students in the class and opened issues if we saw any problems or improvements
to suggest, such as configuration, formatting, factual errors, etc. Below is the list of the issues I opened:

- [Issue 1](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr19/HasanAbdullah31-weekly/issues/1)
- [Issue 2](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr19/DanieSegarra36-weekly/issues/2)
- [Issue 3](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr19/Chocolate-Spaghet-weekly/issues/2)

# Blog 02/22/2019

In the previous week, we evaluated three open source projects:
- [OpenFoodFacts Server](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-server)
- [Netflix Conductor](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-server)
- [DOxygen](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen)

### Was it useful? 
I think it was useful to get more practice in evaluating open source projects. We did a similar exercise last semester which
was equally useful, especially at that time when I was less knowledgable on open source in general. This time around I view
this exercise as a refresher.

### Was it very time-consuming? 

### How would you assess the activity level of a project? 
### Can you propose other ways of doing this?
