# Reported Issues

This week we looked into the blogs of the other students in the class and opened issues if we saw any problems or improvements
to suggest, such as configuration, formatting, factual errors, etc. Below is the list of the issues I opened:

- [Issue 1](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr19/HasanAbdullah31-weekly/issues/1)
- [Issue 2](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr19/DanieSegarra36-weekly/issues/2)
- [Issue 3](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr19/Chocolate-Spaghet-weekly/issues/2)

# Blog 02/22/2019

In the previous week, we evaluated three open source projects:
- [OpenFoodFacts Server](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-server)
- [Netflix Conductor](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-server)
- [DOxygen](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen)

### Was it useful? 
I think it was useful to get more practice in evaluating open source projects. We did a similar exercise last semester which
was equally useful, especially at that time when I was less knowledgable on open source in general. This time around I view
this exercise as a refresher.

### Was it very time-consuming? 
Although it was useful, yes it is very time-consuming. I want to say it took me about 45-60 minutes for each evaluation, I'm 
giving estimations because I did not take note of the time it took for each one. 

### How would you assess the activity level of a project? 
Not that high, after the first evaluation I kind of went into cruise control for the rest. It was more tedious than anything.

### Can you propose other ways of doing this? 
Maybe just focusing in on one project. I think that one project, if selected correctly, can give an ideal view of an open 
source community. If not that, maybe a selection of two open source projects by the student themselves. They can explore 
github for a project that catches their interest and then evaluate from there. That way, they have some interest in the
project it self so it lessens the tedious feeling of the assignment while learning how to evaluate them.
