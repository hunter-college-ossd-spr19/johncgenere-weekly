# Blog 03/08/2019

In the last week, we got into the teams we will be working with for the rest of the semester in attempts to contribute to 
the open-source project of our choosing. The team I am on will be working on [freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp)! So far I have seen three issues that I think I can solve or at least
attempt to. The three issues are:

- [Allow username display to be case-insensitive](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/35525)
  - Description
  - Reasoning
- [Looking for reviewers for C/C++ implementations of selection-sort algorithm](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/35391)
  - Description
  - Reasoning
- [Update Spanish translations for contributing documentations](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/18307)
  - Description
    - Translate six documents from their English version to a Spanish Version
  - Reasoning
    - I am native spanish speaker, therefore I can attempt to fully translate these documents with accuracy.
