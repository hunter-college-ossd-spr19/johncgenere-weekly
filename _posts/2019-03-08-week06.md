# Blog 03/08/2019

In the last week, we got into the teams we will be working with for the rest of the semester in attempts to contribute to 
the open-source project of our choosing. The team I am on will be working on [freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp)! So far I have seen three issues that I think I can solve or at least
attempt to. The three issues are:

- [Allow username display to be case-insensitive](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/35525)
  - Description (as seen on the issue)
    - We want to store a case-sensitive version of usernames for display both in the URL and on the profile itself.
  - Reasoning
    - The reasoning behind my selection of this issue is more of wanting a challenge/extra-practice for the current language I
      am using for most of my projects this semester, JavaScript.
- [Looking for reviewers for C/C++ implementations of selection-sort algorithm](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/35391)
  - Description (as seen on the issue)
    - Looking for anyone proficient with C/C++ to review the imperative and declarative implementations of the selection-sort
      algorithm in [/guide/english/algorithms/sorting-algorithms/selection-sort/index.md](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/guide/english/algorithms/sorting-algorithms/selection-sort/index.md).

      Ideally, any person reading the guide should be able to copy this code into a file or site like repl.it and be able to
      compile and run the code as-is - perhaps adding a main function and a test array would help make this work and help
      users understand better.
  - Reasoning
    - C++ is the language I have been programming in for the last 2+ years and feel very confident in implementing an
      algorithm in C++. 
- [Update Spanish translations for contributing documentations](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/18307)
  - Description
    - Translate six documents from their English version to a Spanish Version
  - Reasoning
    - I am native spanish speaker, therefore I can attempt to fully translate these documents with accuracy.
