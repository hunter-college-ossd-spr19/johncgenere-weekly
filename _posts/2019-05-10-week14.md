# The Final Blog Post
Similar to last semester, I have nothing but great things to say about this course. Although I have been in this course for two semesters now, there are certain things that I still learned this semester that are extremely important. For example, git; I knew a good amount, and I was comfortable using git but those last couple classes on fetch and rebasing were great! Also, using gitg to have a visual representation of the work being done on the current repository was and will be helpful for me.

In regards to the freeCodeCamp contributions, I spoke with one of the contributors and one of my group-mates did the same. We were notified that some of our pull request had multiple file changes due to the fact that we did not start with a clean master. We also got a logical response which was while some of our pull request are from early April, there are people who have pull request open from November; in other words, it takes some time. My first pull request got merged on the next day, but I guess I got lucky.

I have also made contributions to Wikipedia. Those were a bit more tedious since I had to find specific places where there were grammatical errors and then fix them.

You can see all of my contributions on both freeCodeCamp and Wikipedia in the section below.

This is a farewell and a thank you, I appreciate everything that I have been taught dating back to last semester and my appreciation for open-source has grown exponentially! I thought this course was gonna be all contributions but I have picked up many skills along the way and have familiarized myself with things like git and GitHub in which I wasn't too strong in before I began taking these courses.

Until next time, thank you.
