# Blog 03/15/2019

In [last week's blog post](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr19/johncgenere-weekly/blob/gh-pages/_posts/2019-03-08-week06.md), I mentioned three issues that I thought I could fix from the open source project I will be
working on this semester (freeCodeCamp). So far I only have an update on this issue:
- [Allow username display to be case-insensitive](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/35525)
  - Description (as seen on the issue)
    - We want to store a case-sensitive version of usernames for display both in the URL and on the profile itself.
  - Reasoning
    - The reasoning behind my selection of this issue is more of wanting a challenge/extra-practice for the current language I
      am using for most of my projects this semester, JavaScript.
      
I have been looking into the issue and trying to find the correct files in which the changes need to be made. I dabbled a bit 
on my local machine and at first I thought I had something, but I guess not because I saw no changes in the username. That is where
I am at now, soon I will incorporate the rest of my team and see if we can check off the 5 points on the issue.
