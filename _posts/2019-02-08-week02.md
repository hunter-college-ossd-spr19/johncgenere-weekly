# Blog 02/07/2019
Unfortunately I could not part-take in some in-class Git activity due to personal reasons, but I did attempt some of the
[exercises](https://github.com/UOL-CS/gitruler-exercises) provided by the University of Leceister in the UK to make up for it.
These exercises were really useful to get a refresher! 

### Next Possible Contribution(s)?

My first contribution was to the open source project [CKB-Next](https://github.com/ckb-next/ckb-next) with the help of my
group members. The issue we worked on [was this one](https://github.com/ckb-next/ckb-next/issues/58). I want my next
contribution(s) to be for the same reason as to why I wanted to contribute to CKB-Next; to scratch a personal itch. CKB-Next 
solved a personal dilemma of mine and I want the next open-source project that I contribute to do something along those lines.
In the case that I don't find something of the sort, then I will resort to good ol' fun and try to contribute to an open
source game engine. My goal in either case would be to get a pull request merged!
