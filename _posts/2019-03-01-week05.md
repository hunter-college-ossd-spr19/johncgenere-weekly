# Blog 03/01/2019

It's about that time of the semester... it's time to narrow down the search for a project that I want to contribute to! I 
really want to contribute to a project that has a primary programming language that I recently learned in order to test my 
skill level and see where I need to improve. I also want to contribute to something that I am generally interested in. I did 
some research and found a couple of resources like [awesome-for-beginners](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners) 
and [Fixme](https://fixme.ossn.club/) in order to find projects that I might be interested in working on. So far I only have 
one project in mind and it is... [freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp).
> Note: I will update the above if I find any other projects that I would be interested in working on

### Why freeCodeCamp? 
freeCodeCamp offers free lessons on various programming languages and tools. I have actually gone to their [website](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and [YouTube 
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ) to begin learning new languages or familiarizing myself with a new tool. This is a service that I not only use but also 
enjoy; I would love to contribute to what makes that happen. Also, it doesn't hurt that 94.1% of the project is in Javascript 
and I am currently trying to learn more Javascript.
