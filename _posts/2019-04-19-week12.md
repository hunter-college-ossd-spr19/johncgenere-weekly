# Wikipedia

This week we started making contributions to Wikipedia pages. I really did not know where to start because Wikipedia has so many articles so I had to do some digging to find the articles in need of edits. I went to the [Community Portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal) which is a page that list articles that need grammar fixes, updates, clean ups, etc. From this page I looked to find pages that then specifically stated where the fix was needed or just a relatively short article. This is because for the most part, the articles that I knew something about were fine. So if there is an article that I don't know about but I can help in some way, then I will do that. With that being said, I did not want to read extremely large articles about things that I was not interested in or knew about so being told which section needs attention or the article being relatively short was a major help.

These are the two edits I made:
- [Edit to Prison Officer Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prison_officer&diff=prev&oldid=892676162)
- [Edit to Come Look At Me Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Come_Look_at_Me&diff=prev&oldid=892676865)
