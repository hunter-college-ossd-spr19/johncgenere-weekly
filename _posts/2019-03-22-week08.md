# Blog 03/22/2019

This week was kind of rough for me personally. I had projects, presentations, papers, exams, and interviews all due or occuring 
within a three day span. Due to this I was not able to go to the class meeting on March 19th, 2019 so I can not speak much on 
what occurred on those days. 

I did have the chance to reread the slides provided by Patrick Mason from the Open Source Initiative(OSI) which was packed 
with a **lot** of information and I can't wait to continue to discuss this information with the class in the next meeting.

Lastly, in term of contribution to [freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp), there's has been little to
no progress and it had to do with how busy I was this week. I barely had a chance to look at any new issues that my group can 
potentially tackle. This coming week, I am giving myself a personal goal of either working on the issues discussed in previous
blog post or if those have already been closed, find a new issue which seems doable. The next time that the class meets, I will
see if my group is able to do a conference call of sorts to really get the wheels turning! Hopefully I come back with good news
in the next blog post!
