Contributing to an open source project can be difficult enough as it is but learning certain things can ease that process. 
I think that learning more languages can assist in this process because knowing a few languages limits your ability to 
contribute. One can learn a language as they work on a open source project but then you may be more prone to commit basic
errors due to lack of knowledge in said language. Also personally speaking, I have mainly known C++ due to it being the 
language that my school teaches in and its not until recently that I have began to learn more langauges. There's not many C++ 
based open source projects so when I was looking at possible projects to contribute to, if I saw something like JavaScript or
Python I would immediately click away from it; thankfully, I no longer have this issue. I would still like to learn more 
languages in order to increase the number of projects that I am able to understand and work on. I feel like the tools or
languages that I know are still relatively low and would like to increase that number throughout this semester.
