# Blog 03/29/2019
During our last meeting, we further discussed how we could contribute to freeCodeCamp and as a group we looked at the guides 
that freeCodeCamp offer. To be more specific, each of us looked at the languages we were most familiar with to see if 
something is not completely accurate or is something is missing. I looked into the JSX section within the ReactJS guide. 
While I was personally learning ReactJS, I used a tool on the Babel website which allowed me to see how Babel converts JSX 
to HTML. This made it easier for me to see what exactly I was doing in JSX since I am pretty familiar with HTML. I felt like 
this tool would be useful for anybody else who is currently learning ReactJS and might be confused about JSX so I made a pull
request with the link added to JSX section and... IT WAS MERGED!!!! I actually had to make two pull request because on my 
first attempt I used the command 

```
git add .
```

which adds changes to files that occur. I saw that my pull requests had about 2000 additions and deletions even though
I only wanted to add a link so I made another pull requests and specifically added the file using 

```
git add <file path>
```
  
The community was very helpful especially after they saw that I closed my first pull request because of the amount of 
additions and deletions. They commented explaining why that might have happened and they were super nice.
