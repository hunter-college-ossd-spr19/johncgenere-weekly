### About me

Going into my last year (hopefully) of my academic career at Hunter College. Apart from going to school full-time, I also work part-time at a bank. They are surprisingly flexible with my school schedule so even though working part-time and going to school full-time is not easy, it is not as bad as it could be.

### Personal Interests

I follow the eSports scene of any video game really, have always been amazed by the fact that people are playing video games as a career.
