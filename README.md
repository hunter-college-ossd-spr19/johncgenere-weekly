# **Blog Repository -- johncgenere** 

This repository belongs to John Genere and contains weekly blogs written about the assignments that those in the Open Source Software Development(OSSD) course have been tasked with. [These blogs](https://hunter-college-ossd-spr19.github.io/johncgenere-weekly) will give a description of what I have personally done for each assignment and also show the progression I have made in contributing to Open Source Projects.
