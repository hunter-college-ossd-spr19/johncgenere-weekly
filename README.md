# **Blog Repository -- johncgenere** 

This repository belongs to John Genere and contains weekly blogs written about the assignments 
the OSSD has been tasked with. [These blogs](https://hunter-college-cs-ossd.github.io/johncgenere-weekly/) will give a description of what I have personally done for each assignment and also show the progression the OSSD has made in making contributions to Open Source Projects.
